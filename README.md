## 💡 About Me  

I’m a developer who loves turning ideas into **fast, functional, and human-centered applications**.  
From designing responsive UIs to integrating AI workflows, I believe code should *solve problems*, not just pass tests.  

I’ve built over **15 projects** — from dynamic task managers to AI-powered chatbots — combining the MERN stack with tools like **LangChain**, **OpenAI API**, and **Streamlit** to deliver smart, production-ready apps.

## 🧩 What I Build  

✅ **Scalable Web Apps** – Clean architecture, responsive design, and seamless performance.  
✅ **REST APIs & Integrations** – Efficient data flow between frontend & backend systems.  
✅ **AI Workflows** – LangChain, OpenAI, and automation pipelines that make tools think smarter.  
✅ **Automation Agents (MCP)** – Bridging AI models with real-world services (LinkedIn, Gmail, Twilio, etc.)

## 🧭 My Approach  

> *“Challenges don’t slow me down — they sharpen my edge.”*  

Every project I build has a clear purpose: **impact > output**.  
I care about user experience, performance, and real-world adaptability — not just completing a checklist.  
That’s what defines my work ethic and makes my builds stand out.
